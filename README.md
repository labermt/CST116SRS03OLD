Purpose:  

Learn to write programs that use operators and functions.  
Understand conversions and precedence.  


Instructions:  


Part 0:  

Create a project named "Operator" that takes 4 numbers separated by whitespace as input.  

The first 2 numbers are of type "int" named i0 and i1. The last 2 numbers are of type "double" named d0 and d1.  

Using C++ I/O Streams, output the results of the binary operators as shown on page 148 Table 6.3.1.  

Create output that shows the results of these operators for all 3 combinations of types. For example:  

i0 + i1 == 4  
i0 + d0 == 42.1  
d0 + d1 == 42.2  

Left justify the results to the right of the double equals sign.  

Show the output in the order of the operator precedence.  


Part 1:  

Create a program named "Quadratic" that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation.

Prompt the user for input of the values a, b, and c with a clear and concise prompt. 

Solve the quadratic equation and show both the roots.
